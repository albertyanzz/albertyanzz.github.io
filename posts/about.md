title: Hello! I'm Albert
---

&emsp;&emsp;

I am a full-stack engineer with an obsession for solving problems. I'm constantly learning and expanding my horizons, and I'm always open to hearing about new opportunities.

Outside of CS, my interests include the NBA, dance, and playing Pok√©mon with my girlfriend. :\)

&nbsp;

Fun facts:

- I have a 3150 day (as of Aug 2025) streak on Duolingo (and running)
- I've journaled every single day since June 2017 (I can tell you what I've done on any given day since then)

&nbsp;

Some notable courses I took during my time in university (USC):

- Advanced Front-End Web Development
- Professional C++
- Machine Learning
- Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines
- Database Systems
- Advanced Analysis of Algorithms

&nbsp;

Some notable achievements:

- Graduated Summa Cum Laude with a 3.98 GPA
- National Finalist in Prepared Speech and Impromptu Speech competitions
- Scored 2400/2400 on my SATs, which isn't really important anymore, but USC liked it I suppose
