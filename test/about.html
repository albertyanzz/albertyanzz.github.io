<p>I recently graduated from USC with a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Currently, I am on a break as I fulfill my military service obligation in Taiwan.
During this period, I have dedicated my time to continuing my personal education journey by exploring AWS, experimenting with React, and developing my passion project (which will be available soon). Outside of CS, my interests include the NBA, dance, and playing Pokemon with my girlfriend. :)</p>
<p>I have experience in full-stack web development, and I have worked effectively in both team and individual settings. I have also been dipping my toes in cloud engineering and mobile development. Currently, I am seeking opportunities in these areas, so please feel free to contact me if you think there is a role that would be a good fit!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some notable courses I took at USC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced Front-End Web Development</li>
<li>Professional C++</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines</li>
<li>Database Systems</li>
<li>Advanced Analysis of Algorithms</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Some notable achievements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graduated Summa Cum Laude with a 3.98 GPA</li>
<li>National Finalist in Prepared Speech and Impromptu Speech competitions</li>
<li>Scored 2400/2400 on my SATs, which isn't really important anymore, but USC liked it I suppose</li>
</ul>
